Employee Management Web Application

Designed and developed a robust Employee Management web application using cutting-edge technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, REST API, HTML, Bootstrap, Thymeleaf, and MySQL. This application facilitates seamless handling of employee-related data, offering a user-friendly interface for efficient management.

Key Features:

Java and Spring Boot: Leveraged the power of Java and Spring Boot for building a scalable and maintainable backend, ensuring optimal performance and ease of development.

REST API: Implemented RESTful APIs to enable smooth communication between the frontend and backend, allowing for seamless data retrieval and manipulation.

HTML and Bootstrap: Created an intuitive and responsive user interface using HTML and Bootstrap, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing experience across devices.

Thymeleaf: Integrated Thymeleaf, a modern server-side Java template engine, to enhance server-rendered HTML with dynamic content, improving the overall user experience.

MySQL Database: Employed MySQL as the backend database to store and manage employee data securely and efficiently.

Postman: Tested and validated APIs using Postman to ensure functionality and performance, guaranteeing a reliable and error-free application.

This project showcases my proficiency in full-stack development, demonstrating skills in backend programming, RESTful API design, frontend development, and database management. It highlights my ability to create functional and user-friendly applications that meet business requirements effectively.
